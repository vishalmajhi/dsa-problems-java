Data Structures and Algorithms Practice
Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! Here, I will be committing solutions to various DSA problems that I encounter. This repository is a way for me to track my progress and share my solutions with others who may find them helpful.

About
In this repository, you will find solutions to a wide range of DSA problems. These problems are typically sourced from various online platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, and others. I solve them in different programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, etc., to help me improve my problem-solving skills and become a better programmer.

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them for your own learning. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Directory Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

problems/: This directory contains subdirectories for each DSA problem category, such as arrays, linked lists, sorting algorithms, and more. Inside each subdirectory, you'll find the solutions to individual problems, named descriptively.

utils/: This directory contains utility functions and data structures that are commonly used in the solutions. It helps keep the code organized and encourages code reuse.

LICENSE: This repository is under the MIT License, which means you can use the code here for your own projects, but please remember to attribute the source.

Getting Started
If you want to run or test any of the solutions in this repository, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-practice.git
Navigate to the specific problem directory you are interested in:

bash
Copy code
cd dsa-practice/problems/problem-category
Choose a solution file (usually in a programming language of your choice).

Run the code using your preferred development environment or compiler.

You can also explore the utils directory if you need any utility functions or data structures for your own solutions.

Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have a better or more optimized solution to an existing problem or want to add a new problem to the repository, follow these steps:
